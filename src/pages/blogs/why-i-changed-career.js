    <h2>Why I made a career change.<br/>
    <i><font size="2">Posted - 5th Jan</font></i></h2>

    <p>

    I’d always thought that no-one <i>really</i> cared about this sort of stuff, yet I get asked it at least once a week, so if I can point people in the direction of this blog, I should be able to automate my life a little more…!<br/><br/>

  In 2016, I was one of the 66% of Milennials wanting to change career (<a href="https://www.lsbf.org.uk/media/2760986/final-lsbf-career-change-report.pdf">London School of Economics, 2015</a>). The 3 main reasons people don’t make this change happen:<br/><br/>
	1) <b>Fear of losing financial security</b><br/>
	2) <b>Fear of failure</b><br/>
	3) <b>People are undecided on what career to focus on next</b><br/><br/>

Luckily I stumbled into something I love whilst not really looking for it. I was <a href="https://www.welovesalt.com/">recruiting web developers</a> in Sydney and loved the candidates I was meeting, loved the passion they had for their job. I had always enjoyed solving problems methodically, and the media told me that demand in this field would be strong for the next 5 years (minimum). 1/3 blockers down.<br/><br/>

<b>Fear of failure</b><br/>
I had such a fantastic support network of friends & family, who encouraged me and helped me throughout, that fear of failure rarely crossed my mind. I met tonnes of people doing the same as me and as we were all in the same boat, we helped each other lots. When you get rejected after your umpteenth interview, yes, you will have a nagging doubt that you aren’t good enough. But, I kept on applying for jobs, learning new skills, and meeting more people, and with my network supporting me, I got through these tougher times. Second blocker down.<br/><br/>

<b>Financial Security</b><br/>
Financial security was a big one for me as I am the sort of person who creates a daily expenditure spreadsheet in order to keep my finances under control. For my career change, I created multiple spreadsheets, graphs & charts documenting living costs, savings, etc. I weighed up the risk/reward and ultimately decided that it was worth going for.<br/><br/>

A few things I took note of:<br/>
&nbsp; - <i>Where that industry is going (is it growing?)</i><br/>
&nbsp; - <i>What my skills were (do they align?)</i><br/>
&nbsp; - <i>How much money do I have currently.</i><br/>
&nbsp; - <i>What would my starting salary be in this new career.</i><br/><br/>

Ultimately, this came with multiple sacrifices. I had to live at home for around 4 months, whilst my partner lived in London. I had to do some part-time work in order to maintain some sort of income. Eventually I made the decision to spend even more money on a bootcamp (Makers Academy), to speed up my job prospects. This was the correct thing to do in my opinion as I learnt so much, met awesome people who will be good contacts for the future, and made use of their recruitment team to help find a job.<br/><br/>

<b><u>TLDR</u></b><br/>

The key takeaways I got from the past 9 months of learning and self-developing were:<br/><br/>
&nbsp; - <b>Keep learning</b> (every day, keep on progressing) and document your learnings at the end of each day.<br/>
&nbsp; - <b>Meet as many people as possible</b> (meetups, interviews, anyone in the industry you want to get into)<br/>
&nbsp; - <b>Try and focus where your strengths lie</b> (mine isn’t necessarily pure coding, but its communication and documentation which allows me to stand out from other professionals in my field).<br/>
&nbsp; - <b>Have a strong support network</b> - tell your close friends, family, who won’t put pressure on and be supportive. Don’t tell people who will do the opposite (I lied to plenty of people who I couldn’t be bothered with the ‘Whattttt why would you do that?! Thats too hard’, etc, etc)<br/><br/>

For any questions, advice or thoughts - please let me know!<br/><br/>
