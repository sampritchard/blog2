      This was my roadpath to my first job as a developer. All that time spent applying, talking, 
      interviewing, testing. What a relief that I finally landed a job! But 2 months later, I handed 
      my notice in....<br/>

      Why? I knew this wasn't the right role for me, etc, etc.
      Lessons learned? - Always maintain contact/a good relationship with previous interviewers, 
      work mates, etc. 
      - You are allowed to give up. If something doesn't feel right, it usually isn't/
      - Understand the company SO much before you accept the offer. But sometimes this is impossible
        don't beat yourself up if you leave.
